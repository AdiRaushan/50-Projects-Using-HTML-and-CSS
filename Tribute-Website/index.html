            history of world cinema, celebrated for his profound contributions
            to art and culture. Ray's life and work are a testament to his
            unwavering dedication to storytelling, his artistic vision, and his
            commitment to humanism. Ray was born into a family deeply rooted in

            poet and illustrator, while his mother, Suprabha Ray, was an
            accomplished writer. This nurturing environment laid the foundation
            for his creative pursuits. Ray attended Presidency College in
            Calcutta, where he studied economics, but his true passion lay in
            the world of cinema and art.
